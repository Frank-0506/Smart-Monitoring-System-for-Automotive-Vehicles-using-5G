# Smart-Monitoring-System-for-Automotive-Vehicles-using-5G
Our project implements a connected car-based monitoring system for the transport authority. It tracks vehicle registration, insurance, fitness, license, location, and emissions via integrated black box units. This closed-loop solution promotes adherence to transport regulations for safer vehicle operation.
